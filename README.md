Euclid Algorithm is the main GCD is explained as follows
if either or both of a and b is negative, use thier absolute positive value instead
if either a or b is zero then were done the GCD is just the other number value
when configuring a and b to find the GCD you will take the largest number and take away from the smaller  until its reduced down this means the number can't go into the number any longer 
the math equation is GCD = a=b
